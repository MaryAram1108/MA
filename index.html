  <h2 style="color:white;">A few things about me</h2>
<p style="color:white;">My name is Mary Arambula, I am 30 years old. Doing my best to get back to my education and
  continue my major is Computer Informations.
  I work full time as one of the managers at a grocery store and going to school part time. I love soccer and going to
  concerts (pre-pandemic time of course haha).
  In my spare time I like to play the guitar and spend family time with my girlfriend and our daughters.
  Looking forward to learning Javascript and as well as refresh my memory in some of the HTML basics.
